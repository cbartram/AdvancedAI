## Requirements
There are just a few requirements to use this software.

- The Command and Conquer Generals app downloaded from the app store **MUST** be located in the Applications folder on the Mac.
- This script assumes that **NO** other modifications have been done to the `/scripts` portion of command and conquer generals (modding the INIZH.big file and other files is perfectly fine) if so it could render this software useless
- You must know how to double click and run a jar file. Literally you just double click it....
